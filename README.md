CNN model using callbacks and optimizers

The .ipynb file for web scraping and folders with scraped and augmented images is available in assignment-3

A deep learning based Image classification model on 100 Images already scrapped during my previous assignment-3(for each category) + augmenting the training folder data from flipkart for the below categories :





1) Trousers (men) (100 images)

2) Jeans (men) (100 images)



using the optimisers, callbacks and learning rates.

Used all the following optimisers:



1) SGD + Momentum

2) Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent

3) RMSprop

4) Adam

5) Nadam



trained my model for each optimiser for 20 epochs and defined all the callbacks (checkpoint, earlystopping, reducedLRonplateau) on the model and check its performance. Adjust the learning rates and observe the changes and displayed them into the notebook.
